     <p >Neymar primarily plays as either a central striker, second striker, winger or occasionally as an attacking midfielder, and has been described as "a true phenomenon".[287][288] Highlighting both his prolific scoring and playmaking abilities, he stands as PSG's sixth-highest-goalscorer of all time and seventh-highest-assister of all time.[289] He often plays as a left sided forward for both club and country in the team's 4–3–3 formation, drifting infield, due to his energetic pace and playmaking skills; this position allows him to shoot with his stronger foot, or create chances for teammates.[288] Neymar's dribbling skills, tricks and playmaking ability have been described as reminiscent of compatriot Ronaldinho. His main traits are his creativity, vision, passing, finishing, dribbling, feints, touch, and technique, being described as both "electric" and "explosive".[290][291][292] He is a notable exponent of the rainbow flick.[293] A prolific goalscorer,[294] although naturally right-footed, he is capable of scoring with both feet, as well as with his head, and is an accurate free-kick and penalty taker.[288][295] Neymar stated: "I'm always trying to perfect everything – dribbling, shooting, headers and control. You can always improve".[17] He has been inspired by Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi and Wayne Rooney.[296] Neymar cites Kyle Walker as the toughest opponent he has ever faced.[297]</p>
